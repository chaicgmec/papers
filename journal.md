#Title
Measurement - model comparison of secondary organic aerosol over West Africa

#Abstract
Abstracts are hard to write. That's why we do it last.

#Introduction section
We present measurements of SOA over West Africa.
The measurements were made using an AMS, as described in Bloggs et al 2004.
Smith et al have made extensive measurements in this region before, but they haven't yet answered the importatnt question of X.

#Simulations
We simulate formation of SOA over W. Africa, using John's marvellous model.

#Methodology

#Conclustion
Write some conclusions here.

#Figures
Add figures here. It's a draft.

#Acknowledgements
We would like to thank fundings from EU.
